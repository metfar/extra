“The Town's Representative” A Three Acts Story

## INTRODUCTION

At center stage is the host, Roger Jourdan. The large screen in the background shows the intro of the program and the theme sounds behind.
Roger begins the presentation.

– Good evening! Today we will tell the truth about the history of our town and analyze the current situation.

The lights focus on the panel members as he introduces them.

– As always, we have the presence of our collaborators: Doctor Katarzyna Sklodowska, Jean-Paul Pernaut in behalf of The Ministry, and Eng. Divij Kumer for the Chamber of Commerce.

– Our guest of the day was who decided the fate of all. Let's welcome the most celebrated social media influencer, with his brand new high school diploma recently earned, Alex Rangel.

The guest enters by climbing the steps in the center of the stage, covering part of the giant screen, as if he were a sportsman climbing the squared circle. Deafening recorded applause is heard from speakers on the sides.

The presenter welcomes him with a smile and shakes his hand as a gesture of cordiality.

The screen shows a quick summary of the guest’s life progress and his gradual appearances in the media. It ended up when he received the most coveted award of all. In the centre of the screen he is seen raising the award he received from the Prime Minister.

The host escorts him to the privileged location on the stage, surrounded by the panelists.

## BODY

Roger reads some notes while the images pass behind him.

– Our guest was our representative at the last audiovisual award ceremony. But before we remember that moment, let's do a little history.

– Alex born in a wealthy family, he showed technological skills early. All his time was learning and researching, and doing excellent in school– said a voice off. Meanwhile, behind the boy situations of
poverty and starvation were shown on one side, and family photos of the child among toys, on the other side.

– His subsequent experiments managed to solve several of the problems facing the country. There he is with his first-year intermediate school teacher, Mrs. Sklodowska, along with the absolute water filter. It allowed to recover that liquid from the waste.

– Professor Sklodowska had great faith in him. I remember how proud she was when she got that award – Doctor said – and my mother was never emotional.

Alex sees Kasia shed a tear. He turns and sees his teacher on the screen. He misses her too. When he was little, the doctor took care of him in his spare time, if his parents were not there. It seems like that was a lifetime ago. He lowers his head a little and turns to the presenter, hoping that he will soon jump to another topic.

The summary continues. It shows when Mr. Kumer gave the boy an award because of the oatmealer.

It converted minerals into artificial oats synthesizing the components.

Former Prime Minister Julia Herman is with her secretary, Mr. Pernaut, talking at her desk with some photos of the first sighting behind them.

– She was one of the nicest person I have ever met. –said Jean-Paul– I should never have suggested this boy's name. But she wanted a fresh, young voice that would make us look good as a species, not just as a nation. Who would have imagined it. We present him as the best of us. But that boy had changed. He had other interests. He saw himself in the reflection of his followers and not in the people around him.

Rangel looked at image of those beings listening to the speech. He remembered that they were going to be the salvation of humanity. They had pledged to fulfill the wish of the species, in gratitude for allowing them to meet us. He felt a shiver. Everything became very clear in his mind, in the end.


## CONCLUSION

Alex is led away by the guards as he desperately cries out, “It wasn't my fault. I only said that my town, our town, was the best of all. That living here did not need anything or anyone else. I never thought
they would take it literally."

In the general image he appears with a "Guilty" sign and below "we demand responsibility."

The screen shows the strange ship moving away after complying with his request.

The main camera zooms out from the stage in an aerial shot. The edges of the city surrounded by a dome shine in the light of the star. The barren terrain outside of it, to the horizon, shows greenish
reflections from chemical vapors left over from the day of disposal.
