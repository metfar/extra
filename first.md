## Introduction

The curtain opens. At center stage is the host, Roger Jourdan. All lights point to him. The large screen in the background shows the intro of the program and the theme sounds behind.

Roger begins the presentation.

– Good evening, dear viewers! This will be a very special program. We will tell the truth about the history of our town and analyze the current situation.

The lights focus on the panel members as he introduces them.

– To talk about it we count, as always, with the presence of our collaborators: 

· Doctor Katarzyna Skłodowska, specialist in Environmental and Human Sciences;

· Jean-Paul Pernaut in behalf of the Ministry;

· and our friend, Eng. Divij Kumer. President of the Chamber of Commerce.

– Today we have as a guest the protagonist of this story. The man who decided the fate of all. Let's welcome the one who was the most celebrated social media influencer, our ex-representative, with his brand new high school diploma recently earned, Alex Rangel.

The guest enters by climbing the steps in the center of the stage, covering part of the giant screen, as if he were a sportsman climbing the squared circle. Deafening recorded applause is heard from speakers on the sides.

The presenter welcomes him with a smile and shakes his hand as a gesture of cordiality.

The screen shows a summary of the progress the guest made in his gradual appearances in the media. Alex up to the pinnacle of his career, when he received the most coveted award of all. In the center of the screen he is seen raising the award he received from the President of the United Nations.

The host escorts him to the privileged location in the center of the stage, surrounded by the panelists.

## Body

Roger reads some notes while the images pass behind him.

–  Our guest, who just turned eighteen, was our representative at the last audiovisual award ceremony. But before we remember that moment, let's do a little history.

–   Born in a wealthy family, he developed his technological skills from a young age. While some children played ball in the streets and others worked to help their parents, Alex lived isolated from his environment. He spent his time learning and researching in his , and doing excellently in school– said a voice off. Meanwhile, behind the boy situations of poverty and starvation were shown on one side, and family photos of the child among toys, on the other side.

–  His subsequent experiments managed to solve several of the problems facing the country. There he is with his first-year intermediate school teacher, Mrs. Sklodowska, along with the absolute water filter.  It allowed to recover that liquid from the waste.

– Professor Sklodowska had great faith in him. I remember how proud she was when she got that award – Doctor said – and my mother was never emotional.

Alex sees Kasia shed a tear. He turns and sees his teacher on the screen. He misses her too. When he was little, the doctor took care of him in his spare time, if his parents were not there. It seems like that was a lifetime ago. He lowers his head a little and turns to the presenter, hoping that he will soon jump to another topic.

The summary continues. Mr. Kumer, in name of The Chamber of Commerce gave the boy another award for the oatmealer. The device converted the minerals into artificial oats almost identical to the natural one. It synthesized the components. 

The images became darker. Former Prime Minister Julia Herman is with her secretary, Mr. Pernaut, talking at her desk with some photos of the first sighting behind them. 

– She was one of the nicest person I have ever met. –said Jean-Paul– I should never have suggested this boy's name. But she wanted a fresh, young voice that would make us look good as a species, not just as a nation. Who would have imagined it. We present him as the best of us. But that boy had changed. He had other interests. He saw himself in the reflection of his followers and not in the people around him.

Rangel looked at the screen. The image of those beings listening to the speech. He remembered that they were going to be the salvation of humanity. They had pledged to fulfill the wish of the species, in gratitude for allowing them to meet us. He felt a shiver. Everything became very clear in his mind, in the end.

## Conclusion

Alex is led away by the guards as he desperately cries out, “It wasn't my fault. I only said that my town, our town, was the best of all. That living here did not need anything or anyone else. I never thought they would take it literally."

In the general image he appears with a "Guilty" sign and below "the people demand responsibility."

The screen shows the strange ship moving away after complying with his request.

The main camera zooms out from the stage in an aerial shot. The edges of the city surrounded by a dome shine in the light of the star. The barren terrain outside of it, to the horizon, shows greenish reflections from chemical vapors left over from the day of disposal.
