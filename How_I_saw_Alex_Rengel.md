# Reinventing the story

## I

The first time I watched his video confession I did not understand it. I was eight or nine years old and my parents didn't let me watch it all. They just told me that he had done something wrong and that's why we weren't going to watch his stuff anymore.

But I was able to watch the Ministery's short commercials broadcast on TV. They showed the World Conference and a picture of the desert displaying the estimated number of dead. Then, Alex's image as the bad one. Justice, they said.

When I was a child, he was my idol. I watched his documentaries. There were also some cartoons telling his inventions' stories. My parents recorded some for my sister and me. After that event,they also disappeared from my parents' house. I looked for them but I found none of these videos. I used to I watched them every day.

A few months ago I found his confession in the court files where I work. I take care of compressing the trials old information to reuse the storage space for the new data. I found it by chance. Alex did not profess any faith but he was a youtuber. He made videos to tell anyone what he did and when he did it. It wasn't as interesting as his inventor stage, but a lot of my sister's classmates watched him, and sometimes I did too, if they let me.

Every convicted person has the right to confess. He argued that his faith was in technology and particularly audiovisual. Therefore they let him to make his confession through that means. I didn't find any record of anyone watching it before me, but someone must have. The logs probably were purged before.

His was the first media trial of the new era. Alex's video begins with the recording of the trial that everyone has seen.

In a standard trial, the presenter brings the defendant to the stand. Behind him, the testimonial actions for which he was accused were projected. Witnesses speak for or against the defendant and the verdict was issued. The accused is taken to his sentence or released.

In Alex's case, it was the first time this method was applied. None of the witnesses spoke on his behalf. I remember the boy's initial look of confusion and how dark and distraught he was when the guards took him away.

Alex starts his video staring at the ground for a couple of minutes. The camera focuses on him
and behind him is a computer showing the trial stopped.

He looks up. He looks straight into the camera and begins to speak.

-- I was not an unhappy child. Quite the contrary, although I almost never saw my parents other than by phone calls, since they worked hard helping everyone. My teacher, Mrs. Irenka Sklodowska, lived with me, supported me in everything I could think of, she took care of me. Kassia, I mean, Katarzyna Skłodowska was like an older sister to me. They were my present family. I understand why she... I miss her presence so much.

-- Excuse me for not being able to maintain my usual cordiality -- he continues -- but this is a very difficult moment for me. I just watched my trial again. It's terrible. I came to the studio thinking that this would be some kind of release. I thought it was a show like any other and that I was going to be allowed to speak. It was not that. My conviction was broadcast live throughout the town. -- his voice breaks.

-- No one notified me. They just let me see it. I understand them. It's not that I was not guilty. I was fifteen years old and had only been making trivia videos for three years. I was invited to the conference. The Prime Minister introduced me as "The best of us" to the foreign delegates.

Kumar gave me a trophy and now he cannot look at me. -- silent for a minute. He walked across the room. His eyes were glassy and the veins in them dilated. But he doesn't fall apart. He sat back in front of the camera.

-- They had come to see me, I thought back then. Of course not, they came for the inventions, for the water generator and the food generator. They were my best two, to tell the truth, -- he looks down -- and with the last one I was barely eleven years old. -- raises it again and looks at the camera with a gesture of apology.

-- Everyone had talked about terrible whings in the world, overpopulation, scarce resources. I wanted to lighten the mood when they asked me what I thought. An artificial intelligence did the translation. --- he stops. He stops and continues to look at the camera.

-- Every day I dream of the lost. My mind cannot forget... anything. This is my last day. They sentenced me. I accept it. But I was a boy. They put me before them. They took literally. I was a child. Adults, doctors, scientists. A child as the spokesperson? Great idea! Back then, this town was enough for me. They got it wrong. I really thought that this town was enough for me. Today I have to go with those who are not. Maybe I deserve a bit of peace. Irenka would encourage me to do the right thing. I die for what I did and for you to live. Peace be with you.

When I was a child, he was my idol. He still is.
